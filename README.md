# ZNLC
Zak's New Library for C-like environments

(Or a recursive acronym for ZNLC is Not LibC.)

## Introduction

This was developed as a minimal "libc"-like wrapper for building ZNCC and examples.

It is NOT intended as a full libc replacement, but only the necessary parts to link simple programs (you'd still need to implement most of the functions yourself).
